<b>Mining</b> has been a key component of the economy of the United States with a gross contribution of over <b>400 billion</b> to U.S GDP in 2020 & more than 500,000 active employees. The United States is the third largest country in the world with a total area of nearly 10 Million square kilometres & there are diverse metal deposits located all across the Country. The United States Geological Survey recorded around <b>170,000 individual Mines</b> , Prospects & districts of various Metals such as <b>Gold , Iron & Uranium</b>. The following charts provide a breakdown of where there are concentrated areas of metal production and also the commonly produced metals in these areas.

The Most frequently occurring metal deposit is <b>gold</b> and this is focused around the Western side of the country. The <b>Sierra Nevada Mountains</b> which runs between California & Nevada is rich in gold with extensive prospecting operations being undertaken during the 1849 California Gold Rush. The streams & rivers in these areas were so richly concentrated with gold that miners only needed to pan through the river beds to find deposits. Additionally, Silver & Copper are commonly found in conjunction with Gold, leading to their high concentration in these areas aswell as presence in deposits as secondary & tertiary occurrences.


</p>

<p>
  
<b>Iron</b> is found around the Appalachian Mountains in the Eastern states aswell as around Lake Superior near Michigan & Minnesota. The Lake Superior deposits known as the <b>Iron Range</b> cover a smaller area but are extremely dense in Iron ore and account for <b>90%</b> of US Iron production. Iron is unique since it is primarily found alone in deposits.  

</p>


<p>
  
<b>Lead</b> is found almost exclusively in Missouri around a formation known as the <b>"Lead Belt"</b> this area accounts for <b>70%</b> of US lead production. Lead is commonly found alongside Gold & Silver, making mining for these precious metals dangerous due to the effects of lead poisoning.
