<h1> Metal Deposits In The United States</h1>


<p>
Mining has been a key component of the economy of the United States with a gross contribution of over 400 billion to U.S GDP in 2020 & more than 500,000 active employees. The United States is the third largest country in the world with a total area of nearl 10 Million square kilometres & there are diverse metal deposits located all across the Country. The United States Geological Survey recored around 170,000 individual Mines , Prospects & districts of various Metals such as Gold , Iron & Uranium. The following charts provide a breakdown of where there are concentrated areas of metal production and also the commonly produced metals in these areas.

The Most frequently occurring metal deposit is Gold across the United states and this is focused around the Western side of the country. The Sierra Nevada Mountains which runs between California & Nevada is rich in Gold with extensive prospecting operations being undertaken mainly in the past during the 1849 California Gold Rush. The streams & rivers in these areas were so richly concentrated with gold that miners only needed to pan through the river beds to find deposits. Additionally, Silver & Copper are commonly found in conjunction with Gold, leading to their high concentration in these areas.


</p>

<p>
  
Iron is found around the Appalachian Mountains in the Eastern states aswell as around Lake Superior near Michigan & Minnesota. The Lake Superior deposits known as the Iron Range cover a smaller area but are extremely dense in Iron ore and account for 90% of US Iron production.

<p>
  
Lead is found almost exclusively in Missouri around a formation known as the "Lead Belt" this area accounts for 70% of US lead production
