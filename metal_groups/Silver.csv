Gold occurs as fine, rounded inclusions inside of coarse, euhedral pyrite or in contact with pyrite as fracture fillings or along grain boundaries (Corbett, 1980, cited in Sharp, 1984, pg. 138).  The more numerous occurrences are as fillings and boundary coatings.  The gold was further determined to be alloyed with silver and of a size range of 1 to 30 microns with the majority from 5 to 20 microns.\n\nAs reported by Davis and others (1989), gold at the Colosseum Mine is generally submicroscopic and associated with sulfide mineralization, chiefly pyrite.  It occurs as free gold, with minor alloyed silver.  It is primarily in contact with pyrite in fractures in the pyrite or along pyrite grain edges.  Secondarily, it occurs as isolated particles in quartz and other gangue minerals but spatially always close to pyrite, and rarely as particles encased in euhedral pyrite.\n\nThe pyrite mineralization and minor base metal sulfides occur in three distinct styles: (1) as disseminations, (2) as open space filling or vein/fracture filling, and (3) in breccia clasts replacing dolomite.  The pyrite megascopically ranges from absent to 30% of rock volume within the breccia pipes (Davis and others, 1989).\n\nAlthough the gold is apparently spatially and geochemically associated with pyrite, there is only a general proportional relationship between pyrite content and gold content.  Sometimes, a high volume percentage of pyrite has only geochemically anomalous gold.  This makes visual pyrite only a general  grade control tool and not a specific tool  This further makes the ore control  process all the more difficult.\n","Felsic Volcanic Rock","Gneiss,Schist,Sedimentary Rock,Andesite"

Where the volcanics and granodiorite are in depositional contact, the volcanics are more intensely altered and mineralized.  At the Serita Mine, the ore occurs in steeply dipping or vertical zones that extend upward from the basement contact.  The mineralized ""ledges"" are fault-controlled and occur along faults and in association with subsidiary faults oriented 90? or 45? to the strike of the ledges.  At the Chemung Mine, highest ore grades occur at intersections of cross faults and the main veins (""ledges"").  At the Perini and ""Goldfound"" (Gold Fund) mines, stoping is most prevalent on cross faults in the ""ledges"".\n\nThe hard silicified ""ledges"" formed in association with faulting.  Subsequent faulting shattered the ledges, providing permeable passageways for subsequent gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids.  Gouge zones are present along the margins of the ledges.  At the Serita Mine, silicification is areal in extent as compared to silicified linear ""ledges"" in other parts of the district.  All of the productive mines in the district have been in silicified zones or ledges, but not all such zones or ledges have been productive.\n\nThe northeast trending fault zone north of Masonic Mountain is a likely candidate for the deeper portion of the hydrothermal system associated with gold mineralization in the Masonic District. \n","Andesite,Basalt,Granite","Metamorphic Rock,Volcanic Rock (Aphanitic)"
