Sporadic gold values occur along northeast trending structures.  The major mineralization is within 3000 feet of the Goldstrike Stock, although it is believed to be considerably younger than the stock.  Mineralization is also stratigraphically controlled along permeable sedimentary and hydrothermal breccias, bioclastic lenses, and calcareous siltstone horizons that intersect the faults.  At Post, oxide ore generally occurs in the Rodeo Creek unit, while refractory sulfide ore typically occurs in the Popovich Formation.  High grade mineralization (>1.0 opt Au) at Deep Post occurs along the sheared contact between sedimentary and intrusive rocks, and commonly below skarns and hornfels adjacent to the earlier intrusions; auriferous fluids apparently ponded beneath these impermeable lithologies.","Limestone,Carbonate,Mudstone,Siltstone,Sandstone,Chert","Diorite,Granodiorite,Quartz Monzonite,Porphyry"

The predominant permeable host rock lithologies are a basal lithic sandstone (well-sorted litharenite) and  an overlying polylithic breccia (mostly conglomeratic with abundant hydrothermal and tectonic brecciation). Overlying these two lithologies is a thick unit of lacustrine mudstones which appears to have acted as an impermeable cap for localizing silica and gold mineralization in the more permeable units below it. The structural axis and hydrothermal conduit for the Main Zone mineralization does not appear to have a surface expression; but drilling has outlined a major north-south zone about which the gold mineralization has spread laterally. Because the major gold resource has no surface expression, and Quaternary alluvium and basalts blanket much of the area, the presence and amount of any fault displacement of the ore zones is speculative.\nMineralization","Sandstone,Sedimentary Breccia,Granite,Rhyolite,Tuff",""
