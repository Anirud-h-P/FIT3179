Boiling of hydrothermal fluid and microscale hydrothermal brecciation are probably associated with Au-Ag deposition.

The predominant permeable host rock lithologies are a basal lithic sandstone (well-sorted litharenite) and  an overlying polylithic breccia (mostly conglomeratic with abundant hydrothermal and tectonic brecciation). Overlying these two lithologies is a thick unit of lacustrine mudstones which appears to have acted as an impermeable cap for localizing silica and gold mineralization in the more permeable units below it. The structural axis and hydrothermal conduit for the Main Zone mineralization does not appear to have a surface expression; but drilling has outlined a major north-south zone about which the gold mineralization has spread laterally. Because the major gold resource has no surface expression, and Quaternary alluvium and basalts blanket much of the area, the presence and amount of any fault displacement of the ore zones is speculative.\nMineralization","Sandstone,Sedimentary Breccia,Granite,Rhyolite,Tuff",""
